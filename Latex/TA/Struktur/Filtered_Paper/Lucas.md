Department of Physics, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA 02138
We provide Ising formulations for many NP-complete and NP-hard problems, including
all of Karp’s 21 NP-complete problems. This collects and extends mappings to the Ising
model from partitioning, covering and satisfiability. In each case, the required number of
spins is at most cubic in the size of the problem. This work may be useful in designing
adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms.

1. Introduction
1.1. Quantum Adiabatic Optimization
Recently, there has been much interest in the possibility of using adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO)
to solve NP-complete and NP-hard problems [1, 2].1 This is due to the following trick: suppose we have a
quantum Hamiltonian HP whose ground state encodes the solution to a problem of interest, and another
Hamiltonian H0 , whose ground state is “easy” (both to find and to prepare in an experimental setup).
Then, if we prepare a quantum system to be in the ground state of H0 , and then adiabatically change
the Hamiltonian for a time T according to


t
t
H(t) = 1 −
(1)
H0 + HP ,
T
T
then if T is large enough, and H0 and HP do not commute, the quantum system will remain in the ground
state for all times, by the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics. At time T , measuring the quantum
state will return a solution of our problem.
There has been debate about whether or not these algorithms would actually be useful: i.e., whether
an adiabatic quantum optimizer would run any faster than classical algorithms [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], due to
the fact that if the problem has size N , one typically finds
i
h


T = O exp αN β ,

In this paper, when a generic statement is true for both NP-complete and NP-hard problems, we will refer to these
problems as NP problems. Formally this can be misleading as P is contained in NP, but for ease of notation we will simply
write NP.

in order for the system to remain in the ground state, for positive coefficients α and β, as N → ∞. This is
a consequence of the requirement that exponentially small energy gaps between the ground state of H(t)
and the first excited state, at some intermediate time, not lead to Landau-Zener transitions into excited
states [5].2 While it is unlikely that NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time by AQO,
the coefficients α, β may be smaller than known classical algorithms, so there is still a possibility that an
AQO algorithm may be more efficient than classical algorithms, on some classes of problems.
There has been substantial experimental progress towards building a device capable of running such
algorithms [11, 12, 13], when the Hamiltonian HP may be written as the quantum version of an Ising spin
glass. A classical Ising model can be written as a quadratic function of a set of N spins si = ±1:
H (s1 , . . . , sN ) = −

X
i<j

Jij si sj −

hi si .

The quantum version of this Hamiltonian is simply

HP = H (σ1z , . . . , σN
)

(4)

where σiz is a Pauli matrix (a 2 × 2 matrix, whose cousin (1 + σiz )/2 has eigenvectors |0, 1i with eigenvalues
0, 1) acting on the ith qubit in a Hilbert space of N qubits {|+i, |−i}⊗N , and Jij and hi are real numbers.
We then choose H0 to consist of transverse magnetic fields [11]:
H0 = −h0

so that the ground state of H0 is an equal superposition of all possible states in the eigenbasis of HP
(equivalent to the eigenbasis of the set of operators σiz (i = 1, . . . , N )). This means that one does not
expect any level crossings.3 For more work discussing the choice of H, see [14]. Also, note that this class
of Hamiltonians is not believed to be sufficient to build a universal adiabatic quantum computer [15] – at
all times, H(t) belongs to a special class of Hamiltonians called stoquastic Hamiltonians [16].

1.2. Ising Spin Glasses
Ising spin glasses4 are known to be NP-hard problems for classical computers [17], so it is natural to suspect
intimate connections with all other NP problems. For the purposes of this paper, an NP-complete problem
is always a decision problem with a yes or no answer (does the ground state of H have energy ≤ 0?),
whereas an NP-hard problem is an optimization problem (what is the ground state energy of H?). The
class of NP-complete problems includes a variety of notoriously hard problems, and has thus attracted
much interest over the last 40 years [18, 19]. Mathematically, because the decision form of the Ising model
is NP-complete, there exists a polynomial time mapping to any other NP-complete problem.
Analogies between the statistical physics of Ising spin glasses and NP problems have been frequently
studied in the past [20, 21, 22], and have been used to construct simulated annealing algorithms [23]
2

If one is only interested in approximate solutions (for example, finding a state whose energy per site is optimal, in the
thermodynamic (N → ∞) limit, as opposed to finding the exact ground state), one expects T = O(N γ ) [5, 10].
3
This is due to the fact that the eigenbases of H0 and HP are very different, and one has to tune (in our case) 2 parameters
of a 2 × 2 Hermitian matrix to find a matrix with degenerate eigenvalues (the identity matrix). We only have one, t, and
thus do not expect any degeneracies [5].
4
In this paper, we will casually refer to the Ising models we are constructing as “glasses”, as they can be on general graphs
and have both positive and negative couplings Jij . There are various mathematical definitions for a spin glass, none of which
seem to capture properly the physical essence of a glass on all problems. We will be liberal with our use of the word glass,
and refer to any NP problem, formulated as an Ising model, as a glass.

3

which have been quite fruitful in approximate algorithms for problems on classical computers. These
connections have suggested a physical understanding of the emergence of hardness in these problems
via a complex energy landscape with many local minima [24]. Conversely, computational hardness of
solving glassy problems has implications for the difficulty of the solutions to important scientific problems
ranging from polymer folding [25, 26] to memory [27] to collective decision making in economics and social
sciences [28, 29]. Problems of practical scientific interest have already been encoded and solved (in simple
instances) on experimental devices using Ising Hamiltonians [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35].
Finally, we note that Ising glasses often go by the name QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization), in the more mathematical literature [36, 37]. Useful tricks have been developed to fix the
values of some spins immediately [38] and to decompose large QUBO problems into smaller ones [39].

1.3. The Goal of This Paper
Mathematically, the fact that a problem is NP-complete means we can find a mapping to the decision
form of the Ising model with a polynomial number of steps. This mapping can be re-interpreted as a
pseudo-Boolean optimization problem [37]. As the constructions of these pseudo-Boolean optimization
problems (or “p-spin glasses”) often lead to three-body or higher interactions in H (e.g., terms of the
form s1 s2 s3 ), we then conclude by using “gadgets” to reduce the problem to an Ising spin glass, by
introducing a polynomial number of auxiliary spins which help to enforce the three-body interaction by
multiple two-body interactions (s1 s2 ) [40, 41]. As such, we can get from any NP-complete problem to
the Hamiltonian of an Ising spin glass, whose decision problem (does the ground state have energy ≤ 0?)
solves the NP-complete problem of interest. Classical gadgets are useful for many problems in physics as
the physical energy (Hamiltonian) contains three-body interactions, but they are also useful for writing
down many algorithms in other fields (e.g. integer factorization [42]).
However, for generic problems, this is a very inefficient procedure, as the power of the polynomial
can grow quite rapidly. As such, the typical NP-complete problem (of size N ) studied in the context of
Ising glasses is very straightforward to write as a glass with N spins (such as number partitioning, or
satisfiability). The primary purpose of this paper is to present constructions of Ising Hamiltonians for
problems where finding a choice of Hamiltonian is a bit subtle; for pedagogical purposes, we will also
provide a review of some of the simple maps from partitioning and satisfiability to an Ising spin glass. In
particular, we will describe how “all of the famous NP problems”5 [18, 19] can be written down as Ising
models with a polynomial number of spins which scales no faster than N 3 . For most of this paper, we
will find it no more difficult to solve the NP-hard optimization problem vs. the NP-complete decision
problem, and as such we will usually focus on the optimization problems. The techniques employed in
this paper, which are rare elsewhere in the quantum computation literature, are primarily of a few flavors,
which roughly correspond to the tackling the following issues: minimax optimization problems, problems
with inequalities as constraints (for example, n ≥ 1, as opposed to n = 1), and problems which ask global
questions about graphs. The methods we use to phrase these problems as Ising glasses generalize very
naturally.

1.4. What Problems Are Easy (to Embed) on Experimental AQO Devices?
We hope that the reader may be inspired, after reading this paper, to think about solving some of these
classical computing problems, or others like them, on experimental devices implementing AQO. Towards
this end, the reader should look for three things in the implementations in this paper. The first is the
number of spins required to encode the problem. In some instances, the “logical spins/bits” (the spins
which are required to encode a solution of the problem) are the only spins required; but in general,
5

No offense to anyone whose problems have been left out.

we may require auxiliary “ancilla spins/bits”, which are required to enforce constraints in the problem.
Sometimes, the number of ancilla bits required can be quite large, and can be the dominant fraction of
the spins in the Hamiltonian. Another thing to watch out for is the possibility that large separations of
energy scales are required: e.g., the ratio of couplings J12 /J23 in some Ising glass is proportional to N ,
the size of the problem being studied. A final thing to note is whether or not the graph must be highly
connected: does the typical degree of vertices on the Ising embedding graph (not the graph associated
with the NP problem) scale linearly with N ?
It is probably evident why we do not want too many ancilla bits – this simply means we can only encode
smaller problems on the same size piece of hardware. It is a bit more subtle to understand why complete
graphs, or separations of energy scales, are problematic. It is probable that the successful experimental
implementations of AQO with the most qubits are on devices generated by DWave Systems [11, 12, 13].6
As such, we now discuss the ease with which these Hamiltonians can be encoded onto such a device. These
devices may only encode problems via a “chimera” graph. The primary problem with Hamiltonians on
a complete graph is that it is inefficient [43, 44] to embed complete graphs onto the chimera graph. A
primary difficulty is demonstrated by the following simple case: a node v in the complete graph must be
mapped two a pair of nodes u and w on the chimera graph, with the coupling Juw large compared to
other scales in the problem, to ensure that su = sw (so these nodes effectively act as one spin). A second
problem is that some of the Hamiltonians require separations of energy scales. However, in practice, these
devices may only encode couplings constants of 1, . . . , 16, due to experimental uncertainties [11, 12, 13].
This means that it is unlikely that, for very connected graphs, one may successfully encode any H with a
separation of energy scales. A final challenge is that sometimes couplings or qubits are broken – at this
early stage in the hardware development, optimal algorithms have embeddings which are insensitive to
this possibility [45].

2. Partitioning Problems
The first class of problems we will study are partitioning problems, which (as the name suggests) are
problems about dividing a set into two subsets. These maps are celebrated in the spin glass community [24], as they helped physicists realize the possibility of using spin glass technology to understand
computational hardness in random ensembles of computing problems. For completeness, we review these
mappings here, and present a new one based on similar ideas (the clique problem).

2.1. Number Partitioning
Number partitioning asks the following: given a set of N positive numbers S = {n1 , . . . , nN }, is there a
partition of this set of numbers into two disjoint subsets R and S − R, such that the sum of the elements
in both sets is the same? For example, can one divide a set of assets with values n1 , . . . , nN , fairly between
two people? This problem is known to be NP-complete [18]. This can be phrased trivially as an Ising
model as follows. Let ni (i = 1, . . . , N = |S|) describe the numbers in set S, and let
H=A

N
X
i=1

ni si

(6)

be an energy function, where si = ±1 is an Ising spin variable. Here A > 0 is some positive constant.
Typically, such constants are scaled to 1 in the literature, but for simplicity we will retain them, since
6

These devices use quantum annealing, which is the finite temperature generalization of AQO. For this paper, this is not
an important issue, although it can certainly be relevant to experiments.

5

in many formulations a separation of energy scales will prove useful, and retaining each scale can make
it easier to follow conceptually. Classical studies of this problem are slightly easier if the square above is
replaced with absolute value [24].
It is clear that if there is a solution to the Ising model with H = 0, then there is a configuration of
spins where the sum of the ni for the +1 spins is the same for the sum of the ni for the −1 spins. Thus,
if the ground state energy is H = 0, there is a solution to the number partitioning problem.
This Ising glass has degeneracies – i.e., there are always at least two different solutions to the problem.
This can be seen by noting that if s∗i denotes a solution to the problem, then −s∗i is also a solution.
Physically, this corresponds to the fact that we do not care which set is labeled as ±. In the spin glass
literature, the change si → −si , which does not change the form of H, is often (rather loosely) called
a gauge transformation. The existence of a gauge transformation which leaves the couplings unchanged
(as there are no linear terms) implies that all energy levels of H are degenerate. It is possible that there
are 2m ground states (with m > 1). This means that there are m physically distinct solutions to the
computational problem. We only need to find one of them to be happy with our adiabatic quantum
algorithm. We can remove this double degeneracy by fixing s1 = 1. This also allows us to remove one
spin: now only s2 , . . . , sN are included on the graph, and s1 serves as an effective magnetic field. So in
general, we require N − 1 spins, which live on a complete graph, to encode this problem.
If the ground state has H > 0, we know that there are no solutions to the partitioning problem, but
the ground state we do find is (one of) the best possible solutions, in the sense that it minimizes the
mismatch. Minimizing this mismatch is an NP-hard problem, and we see that we do not require any more
fancy footwork to solve the optimization problem – the same Hamiltonian does the trick.

2.2. Graph Partitioning
Graph partitioning is the original [20] example of a map between the physics of Ising spin glasses and
NP-complete problems. Let us consider an undirected graph G = (V, E). with an even number N = |V |
of vertices. We ask: what is a partition of the set V into two subsets of equal size N/2 such that the
number of edges connecting the two subsets is minimized? This problem has many applications: finding
these partitions can allow us to run some graph algorithms in parallel on the two partitions, and then
make some modifications due to the few connecting edges at the end [39]. Graph partitioning is known
to be an NP-hard problem; the corresponding decision problem (are there less than k edges conecting the
two sets?) is NP-complete [18]. We will place an Ising spin sv = ±1 on each vertex v ∈ V on the graph,
and we will let +1 and −1 denote the vertex being in either the + set or the − set. We solve this with
an energy functional consisting of two components:
H = HA + HB
where

is an energy which provides a penalty if the number of elements in the + set is not equal to the number
in the − set, and
X 1 − su sv
HB = B
(9)
2
(uv)∈E

is a term which provides an energy penalty B for each time that an edge connects vertices from different
subsets. If B > 0, then we wish to minimize the number of edges between the two subsets; if B < 0, we
will choose to maximize this number. Should we choose B < 0, we must ensure that B is small enough
6

so that it is never favorable to violate the constraint of HA in order to minimize energy. To determine a
rather simple lower bound on A, we ask the question: what is the minimum value of ∆HB – the change
in the energy contributed by the B-term – if we violate the A constraint once. It is easy to see that the
penalty for violating the A-constraint is ∆HA ≥ 4A. The best gain we can get by flipping a spin is to
gain an energy of B min(∆, N/2), where ∆ is the maximal degree of G.7 We conclude
min(2∆, N )

(10)

N spins on a complete graph are required to encode this problem.
This Hamiltonian is invariant under the same gauge transformation si → −si . We conclude that we
can always remove one spin by fixing a single vertex to be in the + set.
We have written H in a slightly different form than the original [20], which employed a constraint on
the space of solutions to the problem, that

(11)

We will want none of our formulations to do this (i.e., we wish to solve the unconstrained optimization
problem), as the experimental hardware that is being built for quantum optimization can only solve
unconstrained problems. Instead, we encode constraint equations by making penalty Hamiltonians which
raise the energy of a state which violates them.

2.3. Cliques
A clique of size K in an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a subset W ⊆ V of the vertices, of size |W | = K,
such that the subgraph (W, EW ) (where EW is the edge set E restricted to edges between nodes in W )
is a complete graph – i.e., all possible K(K − 1)/2 edges in the graph are present, because every vertex
in the clique has an edge to every other vertex in the clique. Cliques in social networks can be useful
as they are “communities of friends”; finding anomalously large cliques is also a key sign that there is
structure in a graph which may appear to otherwise be random [46]. The NP-complete decision problem
of whether or not a clique of size K exists [18] can be written as an Ising-like model, as follows. We place
a spin variable sv = ±1 on each vertex v ∈ V of the graph. In general, in this paper, for a spin variable
sα , we will define the binary bit variable
sα + 1
.
(12)
xα ≡
2
It will typically be more convenient to phrase the energies in terms of this variable xα , as it will be for
this problem. Note that any energy functional which was quadratic in sv will remain quadratic in xv , and
vice versa, so we are free to use either variable. We then choose

where A, B > 0 are positive constants. We want the ground state of this Hamiltonian is H = 0 if and
only if a clique of size K exists. It is easy to see that H = 0 if there is a clique of size K. However, we
7

The reason we can use N/2 in this formula instead of N has to do with the fact that we are “perturbing” a solution
where HA = 0. Due to the fact that the HA constraint is very penalizing if it is violated by having many spins in the
same partition, it is easy to see that cases where an energy gain of (N − 1)B can be obtained by flipping a spin are very
energetically penalized, and not relevant to the discussion.

wish to now show that H 6= 0 for any other solution. It is easy to see that if there are n xv s which are 1,
that the minimum possible value of H is

2
The most “dangerous” possible value of n = 1 + K. We can easily see that so long as A > KB,
Hmin (K + 1) > 0. We finally note that, given a ground state solution, it is of course easy to read off from
the xv which K nodes form a clique. N spins on a complete graph are required to solve this problem.
A quantum algorithm for this NP-complete problem can be made slightly more efficient so long as the
initial state can be carefully prepared [47].
The NP-hard version of the clique problem asks us to find (one of) the largest cliques in a graph.
We can modify the above Hamiltonian to account for this, by adding an extra variable yi (i = 2, . . . , ∆),
which is 1 if the largest clique has size i, and 0 otherwise. Let H = HA + HB + HC where
HA = A 1 −

(16)

We want cliques to satisfy HA = HB = 0, and to be the only ground states. The Hamiltonian above
satisfies this if A/B is large enough so the constraints of HA = 0 are always satisfied – we can see this by
noting that the first term of HA forces us to pick only one value of yi = n, and the second term fixes us
to choose n vertices. Then HB = 0 ensures that we have a clique. Similarly to the discussion above, we
see that the absence of negative energy states requires A > N B. If the maximal degree of the graph is
∆, this can be simplified to A > ∆B. Now that we know that all ground states are cliques,8 we have to
find the state with the smallest value of yn . This can be obtained by choosing
X
H = −C
xv ,
(17)
v

where C > 0 is some constant. If C is small enough, then the ground state energy is H = −CK, where
K is the size of the largest clique in the graph. To determine an upper bound on C, so that we solve the
cliques problem (as opposed to some other problem), we need to make sure that it is never favorable to
color an extra vertex, at the expense of mildly violating the HA constraint. The penalty for coloring one
extra vertex, given yi = n, is at minimum A − nB − C. We conclude that we must choose
C < A − nB.

(18)

So, for example, we could take A = (∆ + 2)B, and B = C.

2.4. Reducing N to log N Spins in Some Constraints
There is a trick which can be used to dramatically reduce the number of extra yi spins which must be
added, in the NP-hard version of the clique problem above [48]. In general, this trick is usable throughout
this paper, as we will see similar constructions of auxiliary y bits appearing repeatedly.
8

The ground state has H = 0 so long as the edge set is non-empty: any connected pair of edges is a clique of size 2.

8

We know that we want to encode a variable which can take the values 2, . . . , N (or ∆, if we know the
maximal degree of the graph – the argument is identical either way). For simplicity, suppose we wish to
encode the values 1, . . . , N (this is a negligible difference, in the large N limit). Define an integer M so
that
2M ≤ N < 2M +1 .
(19)
Alternatively, M = ⌊log N ⌋ – in this paper, the base 2 is implied in the logarithm. In this case, we only
need M + 1 binary variables: y0 , . . . , yM , instead of N binary variables, y1 , . . . , yN , to encode a variable
which can take N values. It is easy to check that replacing

solves the same clique problem, without loss of generality. (This is true in general for all of our NP
problems.) If N 6= 2M +1 − 1, the ground state may be degenerate, as the summation of ys to a given
integer is not always unique. When actually encoding these problems for computational purposes, of
course, this trick should be used, but for pedagogy and simplicity we will not write it out explicitly for
the remainder of the paper.
Using this trick, we note that solving the NP-hard version of the cliques problem requires N +1+⌊log ∆⌋
spins.

3. Binary Integer Linear Programming
Let x1 , . . . , xN be N binary variables, which we arrange into a vector x. The binary integer linear
programming (ILP) problem asks: what is the largest value of c · x, for some vector c, given a constraint
Sx = b

(21)

with S an m × N matrix and b a vector with m components. This is NP-hard [18], with a corresponding
NP-complete decision problem. Many problems can be posed as ILP: e.g., a supplier who wants to
maximize profit, given regulatory constraints [48].
The Ising Hamiltonian corresponding to this problem can be constructed as follows. Let H = HA +HB
where

and A > 0 is a constant. The ground states of HA = 0 enforce (if such a ground state exists, of course!)
the constraint that Sx = b. Then we set
HB = −B

N
X

ci xi .

(23)

i=1

with B ≪ A another positive constant.
To find constraints on the required ratio A/B, we proceed similarly to before. For simplicity, let us
assume that the constraint Eq. (21) can be satisfied for some choice of x. For such a choice, the largest
possible value of −∆HB is, in principle, BC, where
C=

max(ci , 0).

The smallest possible value of ∆HA is related to the properties of the matrix S, and would occur if we

4. Covering and Packing Problems
In this section, we discuss another simple class of mappings from NP problems to Ising models: “covering”
and “packing” problems. These problems can often be thought of as asking: how can I pick elements out
of a set (such as vertices out of a graph’s vertex set) so that they “cover” the graph in some simple way
(e.g., removing them makes the edge set empty). In this class of problems, there are constraints which
must be exactly satisfied. Many of the problems described below are often discussed in the literature,
but again we review them here for completeness. We conclude the section with the minimal maximal
matching problem, which is a slightly more involved problem that has not been discussed in the AQO
literature before.
These are, by far, the most popular class of problems discussed in the AQO literature. As we mentioned
in the introduction, this is because this is the only class of NP problems (discussed in this paper) for
which it is easy to embed the problem via a graph which is not complete (or close to complete).

4.1. Exact Cover
The exact cover problem goes as follows: consider a set U = {1, . . . , n}, and subsets Vi ⊆ U (i = 1, . . . , N )
such that
[
U=
Vi .
(27)
i

The question is: is there a subset of the set of sets {Vi }, called R, such that the elements of R are disjoint
sets, and the union of the elements of R is U ? This problem was described in [49] but for simplicity, we
repeat it here. This decision problem is NP-complete [18]. The Hamiltonian we use is

2
n
X
X
1 −
HA = A
xi  .
(28)
α=1

i:α∈Vi

In the above Hamiltonian α denotes the elements of U , while i denotes the subsets Vi . HA = 0 precisely
when every element is included exactly one time, which implies that the unions are disjoint. The existence
of a ground state of energy H = 0 corresponds to the existence of a solution to the exact cover problem.
If this ground state is degenerate, there are multiple solutions. N spins are required.
It is also straightforward to extend this, and find the smallest exact cover (this makes the problem
NP-hard). This is done by simply adding a second energy scale: H = HA + HB , with HA given above,
and
X
HB = B
xi .
(29)
i

10

The ground state of this model will be mB, where m is the smallest number of subsets required. To find
the ratio A/B required to encode the correct problem, we note that the worst case scenario is that there
are a very small number of subsets with a single common element, whose union is U . To ensure this does
not happen, one can set A > nB.9

4.2. Set Packing
Let us consider the same setup as the previous problem, but now ask a different question: what is
the largest number of subsets Vi which are all disjoint? This is called the set packing problem; this
optimization problem is NP-hard [18]. To do this, we use H = HA + HB :
X
HA = A
xi xj ,
(30)
i,j:Vi ∩Vj 6=∅

which is minimized only when all subsets are disjoint. Then, we use
X
HB = −B
xi

(31)

i

which simply counts the number of sets we included. Choosing B < A ensures that it is never favorable
to violate the constraint HA (since there will always be a penalty of at least A per extra set included) [4].
Note that an isomorphic formulation of this problem, in the context of graph theory is as follows: let
us consider the sets to be encoded in an undirected graph G = (V, E), where each set Vi maps to to a
vertex i ∈ V . An edge ij ∈ E exists when Vi ∩ Vj is nonempty. It is straightforward to see that if we
replace
X
HA = A
xi xj
(32)
ij∈E

that the question of what is the maximal number of vertices which may be “colored” (xi = 1) such that no
two colored vertices are connected by an edge, is exactly equivalent to the set packing problem described
above. This version is called the maximal independent set (MIS) problem.

4.3. Vertex Cover
Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), what is the smallest number of vertices that can be “colored”
such that every edge is incident to a colored vertex? This is NP-hard; the decision form is NP-complete
[18]. Let xv be a binary variable on each vertex, which is 1 if it is colored, and 0 if it is not colored. Our
Hamiltonian will be H = HA + HB . The constraint that every edge has at least colored vertex is encoded
in HA :
X
HA = A
(1 − xu )(1 − xv ).
(33)
uv∈E

Then, we want to minimize the number of colored vertices with HB :
X
HB = B
xv

(34)

v

Choose B < A, as if we uncolor any vertex that ruins the solution, at least one edge will no longer connect
to a colored vertex. The number of spins required is |V |, the size of the vertex set.
9

The example where V = {{1, 2}, {3}, . . . , {n}, {2, . . . , n}} shows that to leading order in n, this bound is optimal.

11

4.4. Satisfiability
Satisfiability is one of the most famous NP-complete problems [18]. Every satisfiability problem can be
written as a so-called 3SAT problem in conjunctive normal form (and this algorithm takes only polynomial
steps/time) and so we will focus for simplicity on this case. In this case, we ask whether
Ψ = C1 ∧ C2 · · · ∧ Cm

(35)

can take on the value of true – i.e., every Ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ m is true, where the form of each Ci is:
C i = y i1 ∨ y i2 ∨ y i3

(36)

Here yi1 , yi2 and yi3 are selected from another set of Boolean variables: x1 , . . . , xN , x1 , . . . , xN . This
is a very brief description of satisfiability; physicists who are unfamiliar with this problem should read
appropriate chapters of [24].
There is a well-known reduction of 3SAT to MIS [49] which we reproduce here, for completeness.
Consider solving the set packing problem on a graph G with 3m nodes, which we construct as follows.
For each clause Ci , we add 3 nodes to the graph, and connect each node to the other 3. After this step,
if there is a y1 and y2 such that y1 = y2 , then we also add an edge between these two nodes. Solving MIS
on this graph, and asking whether the solution has exactly m nodes, is equivalent to solving the 3SAT
problem. This can be seen as follows: if a solution to the 3SAT problem exists, only one element of each
clause needs to be true – if more are true, that is also acceptable, but we must have that one is true, so
let us choose to color the vertex corresponding to the variable which is true. However, we may also not
choose to have both x1 be true and x1 be true, so we are required to connect all such points with an edge.
Since the graph is made up of m connected triangles, the only way to color m vertices if each vertex is in
a distinct triangle, so there must be an element of each clause Ci which is true.
Note that we can solve an NP-hard version of this problem (if we have to violate some clauses, what
is the fewest number?), by solving the optimization version of the MIS problem.

4.5. Minimal Maximal Matching
The minimal maximal (minimax) matching problem on a graph is defined as follows: let G = (V, E)
denote an undirected graph, and let C ⊆ E be a proposed “coloring”. The constraints
on C are as
S
follows: for each edge in C, let us color the two vertices it connects: i.e. let D = e∈C ∂e. We will then
demand that: no two edges in C share a vertex (if e1 , e2 ∈ C, ∂e1 ∩ ∂e2 = ∅) and that if u, v ∈ D, that
(uv) ∈
/ E. This is NP-hard; the decision problem is NP-complete [19]. This is minimal in that we cannot
add any more edges to C (coloring any appropriate vertices) without violating the first constraint, and
maximal in the sense that the trivial empty set solution is not allowed – we must include all edges between
uncolored vertices.
Note that, from this point on in this paper, we have not found any of the Ising formulations of this
paper in the literature.
We will use the spins on the graph to model whether or not an edge is colored. Let us use the binary
variable xe to denote whether or not an edge is colored; thus, the number of spins is |E| = O(∆N ), the
size of the edge set; as before, ∆ represents the maximal degree. To encode this problem, we use a series
of three Hamiltonians:
H = HA + HB + HC .
(37)
The first and largest term, HA , will impose the constraint that no vertex has two colored edges. This can
be done by setting
X X
HA = A
xe 1 xe 2 .
(38)
v {e1 ,e2 }⊂∂v

12

Here A > 0 is a positive energy, and ∂v corresponds to the subset of E of edges which connect to v. Thus
the ground states consist of HA = 0; if HA > 0, it is because there is a vertex where two of its edges are
colored.
We also can define, for states with HA = 0, the variable

X
1 v has a colored edge
yv ≡
=
xe .
(39)
0 v has no colored edges
e∈∂v

We stress that this definition is only valid for states with HA = 0, since in these states each vertex has
either 0 or 1 colored edges. We then define the energy HB , such that solutions to the minimax coloring
problem also have HB = 0. Since we have already constrained the number of colored edges per vertex,
we choose HB to raise the energy of all solutions where there exists a possible edge which can be colored,
yet still not violate the coloring condition, out of the ground state. To do this, we can sum over all edges
in the graph, and check whether or not the edge connects two vertices, neither of which are colored:
X
HB = B
(1 − yu )(1 − yv ).
(40)
e=(uv)

Note that since, 1 − yv can be negative, we must choose B > 0 to be small enough. To bound B, we note
that the only problem (a negative term in HB ) comes when yu = 0, yv > 1, and (uv) ∈ E. Suppose that
m of v’s neighbors have yu = 0. Then, the contributions to HA and HB associated to node v are given by
Hv = A

yv (yv − 1)
− B(yu − 1)m.
2

(41)

Note that m + yu ≤ k, if k is the degree of node v. Putting all of this together, we conclude that if ∆ is
the maximal degree in the graph, because the worst case scenario is yv = 2, m = ∆ − 2, if we pick
A > (∆ − 2)B,

(42)

then it is never favorable to have any yv > 1. This will ensure that a ground state of HA + HB will have
HA = HB = 0: i.e., states which do not violate the minimax constraints.
Now, given the states where HA = HB = 0, we now want the ground state of HA + HB + HC to be
the state where the fewest number of edges are colored. To do this, we simply let
X
HC = C
xe
(43)
e

count the number of colored edges. Here C is an energy scale chosen to be small enough such that it
is never energetically favorable to violate the constraints imposed by either the HA or HB terms: one
requires C < B, since there is an energy penalty of B associated to each edge which could be colored,
but isn’t. The term with the smallest HC has the smallest number of edges, and is clearly the solution
to the minimax problem. Each ground state of this spin model is equivalent to a solution of the minimax
problem.

5. Problems with Inequalities
We now turn to NP problems whose formulations as Ising models are more subtle, due to the fact that
constraints involve inequalities as opposed to equalities. These constraints can be re-written as constraints
only involving equalities by an expansion of the number of spins.
As with partitioning problems, we will find that these Hamiltonians require embedding highly connected graphs onto a quantum device. This may limit their usability on current hardware.
13

5.1. Set Cover
Consider a set U = {1, . . . , n}, with sets Vi ⊆ U (i = 1, . . . , N ) such that
U=

N
[

Vα .

(44)

i=1

The set covering problem is to find the smallest possible number of Vi s, such that the union of them is
equal to U . This is a generalization of the exact covering problem, where we do not care if some α ∈ U
shows up in multiple sets Vi ; finding the smallest number of sets which “cover” U is NP-hard [18].
Let us denote xi to be a binary variable which is 1 if set i is included, and 0 if set i is not included.
Let us then denote xα,m to be a binary variable which is 1 if the number of Vi s which include element α
is m ≥ 1, and 0 otherwise. Set H = HA + HB . Our first energy imposes the constraints that exactly one
xα,m must be 1, since each element of U must be included a fixed number of times, and that the number
of times that we claimed α was included is in fact equal to the number of Vi we have included, with α as
an element:

Finally, we minimize over the number of Vα s included:

(46)

i=1

with 0 < B < A required to never violate the constraints of HA (the worst case is that one set must be
included to obtain one element of U ; the change in H if we include this last element is B − A, which must
be negative).
Let M ≤ N be the maximal number of sets which contain any given element of U ; then N xi s are
required, and n⌊1 + log M ⌋ spins are required (using the trick described earlier) for the xα,m spins; the
total number is therefore N + n⌊1 + log M ⌋ spins.

5.2. Knapsack with Integer Weights
The knapsack problem is the following problem: we have a list of N objects, labeled by indices α, with
the weight of each object given by wα , and its value given by cα , and we have a knapsack which can only
carry weight W . If xα is a binary variable denoting whether (1) or not (0) object α is contained in the
knapsack, the total weight in the knapsack is
W=
and the total cost is
C=

N
X

wα xα

(47)

The NP-hard [18] knapsack problem asks us to maximize C subject to the constraint that W ≤ W . It
has a huge variety of applications, particularly in economics and finance [50].

14

Let yn for 1 ≤ n ≤ W denote a binary variable which is 1 if the final weight of the knapsack is n, and
0 otherwise. Our solution consists of letting H = HA + HB , with
HA = A 1 −

which enforces that the weight can only take on one value and that the weight of the objects in the
knapsack equals the value we claimed it did, and finally
X
HB = −B
cα xα .
(50)
α

As we require that it is not possible to find a solution where HA is weakly violated at the expense of HB
becoming more negative, we require 0 < B max(cα ) < A (adding one item to the knapsack, which makes
it too heavy, is not allowed). The number of spins required is (using the log trick) N + ⌊1 + log W ⌋.

6. Coloring Problems
We now turn to coloring problems. Naively, coloring problems are often best phrased as Potts models
[51], where the spins can take on more than two values, but these classical Potts models can be converted
to classical Ising models with an expansion of the number of spins. This simple trick forms the basis for
our solutions to this class of problems.

6.1. Graph Coloring
Given an undirected graph G = (V, E), and a set of n colors, is it possible to color each vertex in the
graph with a specific color, such that no edge connects two vertices of the same color? This is one of
the more famous NP-complete [18] problems, as one can think of it as the generalization of the problem
of how many colors are needed to color a map, such that no two countries which share a border have
the same color. Of course, in this special case,10 one can prove that there is always a coloring for n ≥ 4
[52, 53]. This problem is called the graph coloring problem.
Our solution consists of the following: we denote xv,i to be a binary variable which is 1 if vertex v is
colored with color i, and 0 otherwise. The energy is
H=A

X
v

1−

n
X
i=1

xv,i

!2

+A

n
X X

xu,i xv,i .

(51)

(uv)∈E i=1

The first term enforces the constraint that each vertex has exactly one color, and provides an energy
penalty each time this is violated, and the second term gives an energy penalty each time an edge
connects two vertices of the same color. If there is a ground state of this model with H = 0, then there
is a solution to the coloring problem on this graph with n colors. We can also read off the color of each
node (in one such coloring scheme) by looking at which xs are 1. Note that the number of spins can be
slightly reduced, since there is a permutation symmetry among colorings, by choosing a specific node in
the graph to have the color 1, and one of its neighbors to have the color 2, for example. The total number
of spins required is thus nN .
10
The graphs are planar – the vertices can be realized by points on R2 , and the edges as line segments between them, such
that no two line segments intersect (except at a vertex).

15

6.2. Clique Cover
The clique cover problem, for an undirected graph G = (V, E), is the following: given n colors, we assign
a distinct color to each vertex of the graph. Let W1 , . . . , Wn be the subsets of V corresponding to each
color, and EW1 , . . . , EWn the edge set restricted to edges between vertices in the Wi sets. The clique cover
problem asks whether or not (Wi , EWi ) is a complete graph for each Wi (i.e., does each set of colored
vertices form a clique?). This problem is known to be NP-complete [18].
Our solution is very similar to the graph coloring problem. Again, we employ the same binary variables
as for graph coloring, and use a Hamiltonian very similar to the cliques problem:


The first term enforces the constraint that each vertex has exactly one color by giving an energy penalty
each time this constraint is violated. In the second term, since the sum over v of xv,i counts the number
of nodes with color i, the first sum counts highest possible number of edges that could exist with color i.
The second term then checks if, in fact, this number of edges does in fact exist. Thus H = 0 if and only
if the clique cover problem is solved by the given coloring. If a ground state exists with H = 0, there is a
solution to the clique covering problem. The discussion on the required ratio A/B to encode the correct
solution is analogous to the discussion for the cliques problem. The total number of spins required is nN .

6.3. Job Sequencing with Integer Lengths
The job sequencing problem is as follows: we are given a list of N jobs for m computer clusters. Each job
i has length Li . How can each job be assigned to a computer in the cluster such that, if the set of jobs
on cluster α is Vα , then the length of that cluster, defined as
X
Li ,
(53)
Mα ≡
i∈Vα

are chosen such that max(Mα ) is minimized? Essentially, this means that if we run all of the jobs
simultaneously, all jobs will have finished running in the shortest amount of time. This is NP-hard [18],
and there is a decision version (is max(Mα ) ≤ M0 ?) which is NP-complete. We assume that Li ∈ N.
To do this, we will begin by demanding that without loss of generality, M1 ≥ Mα for any α. Introduce
the variables xi,α which are 1 if job i is added to computer α, and 0 otherwise, and the variables yn,α for
α 6= 1 and n ≥ 0, which is 1 if the difference M1 − Mα = n. Then the Hamiltonian

encodes that each job can be given to exactly one computer, and that no computer can have a longer
total length than computer 1. The number M must be chosen by the user, and is related to the number
of auxiliary spins required to adequately impose the length constraints that M1 ≥ Mα : in the worst case,
it is given by N max(Li ). To find the minimal maximal length M1 , we just use
X
HB = B
Li xi,1 .
(55)
i

Similarly to finding bounds on A/B for the knapsack problem, for this Hamiltonian to encode the solution
to the problem, we require (in the worst case) 0 < B max(Li ) < A. Using the log trick, the number of
spins required here is mN + (m − 1)⌊1 + log M⌋.

7. Hamiltonian Cycles
In this section, we describe the solution to the (undirected or directed) Hamiltonian cycles problem,
and subsequently the traveling salesman problem, which for the Ising spin glass formulation, is a trivial
extension.

7.1. Hamiltonian Cycles and Paths
Let G = (V, E), and N = |V |. The graph can either be directed or undirected; our method of solution
will not change. The Hamiltonian path problem is as follows: starting at some node in the graph, can
one travel along an edge, visiting other nodes in the graph, such that one can reach every single node in
the graph without ever returning to the same node twice? The Hamiltonian cycles problem asks that, in
addition, the traveler can return to the starting point from the last node he visits. Hamiltonian cycles is
a generalization of the famous Königsberg bridge problem [24], and is NP-complete [18].
Without loss of generality, let us label the vertices 1, . . . , N , and take the edge set (uv) to be directed
– i.e., the order uv matters. It is trivial to extend to undirected graphs, by just considering a directed
graph with (vu) added to the edge set whenever (uv) is added to the edge set. Our solution will use N 2
bits xv,i , where v represents the vertex and i represents its order in a prospective cycle. Our energy will
have three components. The first two things we require are that every vertex can only appear once in a
cycle, and that there must be a j th node in the cycle for each j. Finally, for the nodes in our prospective
ordering, if xu,j and xv,j+1 are both 1, then there should be an energy penalty if (uv) ∈
/ E. Note that
N + 1 should be read as 1, in the expressions below, if we are solving the cycles problem. These are
encoded in the Hamiltonian:

/ j=1

A > 0 is a constant. It is clear that a ground state of this system has H = 0 only if we have an ordering
of vertices where each vertex is only included once, and adjacent vertices in the cycle have edges on the
graph – i.e., we have a Hamiltonian cycle.
To solve the Hamiltonian path problem instead, restrict the last sum over j above from 1 to N − 1;
we do not care about whether or not the first and last nodes are also connected. N 2 spins are requied to
solve this problem.
It is straightforward to slightly reduce the size of the state space for the Hamiltonian cycles problem
as follows: it is clear that node 1 must always be included in a Hamiltonian cycle, and without loss of
generality we can set x1,i = δ1,i : this just means that the overall ordering of the cycle is chosen so that
node 1 comes first. This reduces the number of spins to (N − 1)2 .

7.2. Traveling Salesman
The traveling salesman problem for a graph G = (V, E), where each edge uv in the graph has a weight
Wuv associated to it, is to find the Hamiltonian cycle such that the sum of the weights of each edge in the
cycle is minimized. Typically, the traveling salesman problem assumes a complete graph, but we have the
technology developed to solve it on a more arbitrary graph. The decision problem (does a path of total
weight ≤ W exist?) is NP-complete [18].
To solve this problem, we use H = HA + HB , with HA the Hamiltonian given for the directed (or

17

undirected) Hamiltonian cycles problem. We then simply add
HB = B

X

Wuv

N
X

xu,j xv,j+1 .

(57)

j=1

(uv)∈E

with B small enough that it is never favorable to violate the constraints of HA ; one such constraint is
0 < B max(Wuv ) < A (we assume in complete generality Wuv ≥ 0 for each (uv) ∈ E).11 If the traveling
salesman does not have to return to his starting position, we can restrict the sum over j from 1 to N − 1,
as before. As with Hamiltonian cycles, (N − 1)2 spins are required, as we may fix node 1 to appear first
in the cycle.

8. Tree Problems
The most subtle NP problems to solve with Ising models are problems which require finding connected
tree subgraphs of larger graphs.12 Because determining whether a subgraph is a tree requires global
information about the connectivity of a graph, we will rely on similar tricks to what we used to write
down Hamiltonian cycles as an Ising model.

8.1. Minimal Spanning Tree with a Maximal Degree Constraint
The minimal spanning tree problem is the following: given an undirected graph G = (V, E), where each
edge (uv) ∈ E is associated with a cost cuv , what is the tree T ⊆ G, which contains all vertices, such that
the cost of T , defined as
X
c(T ) ≡
cuv ,
(58)
(uv)∈ET

is minimized (if such a tree exists)? Without loss of generality, we take cuv > 0 in this subsection (a
positive constant can always be added to each cuv ensure that the smallest value of cuv is strictly positive,
without changing the trees T which solve the problem). We will also add a degree constraint, that each
degree in T be ≤ ∆. This makes the problem NP-hard, with a corresponding NP-complete decision
problem [18].
To solve this problem, we place a binary variable ye on each edge to determine whether or not that
edge is included in T :

We also place a large number of binary variables xv,i on each vertex, and xuv,i , xvu,i on edge (uv) (these
are distinct spins): the number i = 0, 1, . . . , N/2 will be used to keep track of the depth a node in the
tree, and if xuv = 1, it means that u is closer to the root than v, and if xvu = 1 it means that v is closer
to the root. Finally, we use another variable zv,i (i = 1, . . . ∆) to count the number of degrees of each
node. We now use energy H = HA + HB , where the terms in HA are used to impose the constraints that:
there is exactly one root to the tree, each vertex has a depth, each bond has a depth, and its two vertices
must be at different heights, the tree is connected (i.e., exactly one edge to a non-root vertex comes from
11
One can also encode graph structure by assuming a complete graph (this allows one to neglect the third term in HA ),
but choosing the weights of the “non-existent” edges to obey Wuv∈E
≥ N max(Wuv∈E ). As Wuv is not defined if (uv) ∈

these are in fact two identical interpretations.

A tree is a graph with no cycles. A cycle is set of vertices v1 , . . . , vn with (v1 v2 ), . . . , (vn−1 vn ), (vn v1 ) ∈ E. It is easy to
check that if (V, E) is a tree, |E| = |V | − 1.

The ground states with HA = 0 are trees which include every vertex. In the last term in the sum, remember

In order to solve the correct problem, we need to make sure that we never remove any xuv,i from HB
in order to have a more negative total H. As each constraint in HA contributes an energy ≥ A if it is
violated, we conclude that setting 0 < B max(cuv ) < A is sufficient. The minimum of E will find the
minimal spanning tree, subject to the degree constraint.
The number of spins required is |V |(⌊|V | + 1⌋ + 2)/2 + |E|(|V | + 1) + |V |⌊1 + log ∆⌋. The maximal
possible number of edges on any graph is |E| = O(|V |2 ), so this Ising formulation may require a cubic
number of spins in the size of the vertex set.

8.2. Steiner Trees
The NP-hard [18] Steiner tree problem is somewhat similar to the problem above: given our costs cuv , we
want to find a minimal spanning tree for a subset U ⊂ V of the vertices (i.e., a tree such that the sum of
cuv s along all included edges is minimal). We no longer impose degree constraints; the problem turns out
to be “hard” already, as we now allow for the possibility of not including nodes which are not in U .
To solve this by finding the ground state of an Ising model, we use the same Hamiltonian as for the
minimal spanning tree, except we add binary variables yv for v ∈
/ U which determine whether or not a
node v is included in the tree. We use the Hamiltonian H = HA + HB , where HA enforces constraints
similarly to in the previous case:

We then use HB from the previous model to determine the minimum weight tree; the same constraints

8.3. Directed Feedback Vertex Set
A feedback vertex set for a directed graph G = (V, E) is a subset F ⊂ V such that the subgraph
(V − F, ∂(V − F )) is acyclic (has no cycles). We will refer to F as the feedback set. Solving a decision
problem for whether or not a feedback set exists for |F | ≤ k is NP-complete [18]. We solve the optimization
problem of finding the smallest size of the feedback set first for a directed graph – the extension to an
undirected graph will be a bit more involved.
Before solving this problem, it will help to prove two lemmas. The first lemma is quite simple: there
exists a node in a directed acyclic graph which is not the end point of any edges. Suppose that for each
vertex, there was an edge that ends on that vertex. Then pick an arbitrary vertex, pick any edge ending
on that vertex, and follow that edge in reverse to the starting vertex. Repeat this process more than N
times, and a simple counting argument implies that we must have visited the same node more than once,
at least once. Thus, we have traversed a cycle in reverse, which contradicts our assumption.
The second lemma is as follows: a directed graph G = (V, E) is acyclic if and only if there is a height
function h : V → N such that if uv ∈ E, h(u) < h(v): i.e., every edge points from a node at lower
height to one at higher height. That height function existence implies acyclic is easiest to prove using the
contrapositive: suppose that a graph is cyclic. Then on a cycle of edges, we have
X
0<
[h(ui+1 ) − h(ui )] = h(u1 ) − h(un ) + h(un ) − h(un−1 ) + · · · − h(u1 ) = 0
(63)
is a contradiction. To prove that an acyclic graph has a height function, we construct one recursively.
Using our first lemma, we know that there exists a vertex u with only outgoing edges, so let us call
h(u) = 1. For any other vertex, we will call the height of that vertex h(v) = 1 + h′ (v), where h′ (v) is
found by repeating this process on the graph with node u removed (which must also be acyclic). It is
clear this process will terminate and assign exactly one node height i for each integer 1 ≤ i ≤ |V |.
We can now exploit this lemma to write down an Ising spin formulation of this problem. We place a
binary variable yv on each vertex, which is 0 if v is part of the feedback set, and 1 otherwise. We then
place a binary variable xv,i on each vertex, which is 1 if vertex v is at height i. So far the heights i are
arbitrary, and the requirement that a height function be valid will be imposed by the energy. The energy
functional we use is H = HA + HB where
!2

(64)
HA = A

The first term ensures that if a vertex is not part of the feedback set, it has a well-defined height; the
second term ensures that an edge only connects a node with lower height to a node at higher height. We
then find the smallest possible feedback set by adding
X
HB = B
(1 − yv ).
(65)
v

In order to solve the correct problem, we cannot add too few nodes to the feedback set. If we set yv = 1
for a node which should be part of the feedback set, we find an energy penalty of A from HA , and a gain
of B from HB . We conclude that B < A is sufficient to ensure we solve the correct problem. We see that
|V |(|V | + 1) spins are required.

8.4. Undirected Feedback Vertex Set
The extension to undirected graphs requires a bit more care. In this case, we have to be careful because
there is no a priori distinction on whether the height of one end of an edge is smaller or larger than the
20

other – this makes the problem much more involved, at first sight. Furthermore, it is not true that a
directed acyclic graph is acyclic if the orientation of edges is ignored. However, for an undirected graph,
we also know that a feedback vertex set must reduce the graph to trees, although there is no longer
a requirement that these trees are connected (this is called a forest). With this in mind, we find that
the problem is actually extremely similar to minimal spanning tree, but without degree constraints or
connectivity constraints. The new subtlety, however, is that we cannot remove edges.
To solve this problem, we do the following: introduce a binary variable xv,i , which is 1 if v is a vertex
in any tree (anywhere in the forest) at depth i, and 0 otherwise. However, to account for the fact that we
may remove vertices, we will allow for yv = 1 if v is part of the feedback vertex set, and 0 otherwise. We
do a similar thing for edges: we consider xuv,i , xvu,i to be defined as before when i > 0. We also define the
variables yuv , yvu , which we take to be 1 when the ending node of the “directed” edge is in the feedback
vertex set. Now, we can write down a very similar energy to the minimal spanning tree:
HA = A

(66)

The changes are as follows: we no longer constrain only 1 node to be the root, or constrain the degree of a
vertex – however, we have to add a new term to ensure that edges are only ignored in the tree constraint
if they point to a node in the feedback set. We then add
X
HB = B
yv
(67)
v

with B < A required so that the A constraints are never violated. This counts the number of nodes in
the feedback set, so thus H is minimized when HB is smallest – i.e., we have to remove the fewest number
of nodes. The number of spins required is (|E| + |V |)⌈(|V | + 3)/2⌉.13
The recent paper [54] has a more efficient implementation of a mapping, for use in understanding
random ensembles of this problem by the replica method. Unfortuntaely, this technique is not efficient
for AQO; the Hamiltonian contains N -body terms.

8.5. Feedback Edge Set
For a directed graph, the feedback edge set problem is to find the smallest set of edges F ⊂ E such that
(V, E − F ) is a directed acyclic graph. It is known to be NP-hard [18].14 Our solution will be somewhat
similar to the directed feedback vertex set. We place a binary variable yuv on each edge, which is 1 if
uv ∈
/ F , and define xuv,i to be 1 if both yuv = 1 and the height of node u is i. We also add a binary
variable xv,i , as for the feedback vertex set. Our constraint energy must then enforce that: each vertex
and included edge has a well-defined height, and that each edge points from a lower height to a higher
height:

This follows from the fact that the sum over is is ⌈(|V | + 1)/2⌉; then we account for the ys.

We then use
HB = B

X

(69)

to count the number of edges in F – it is minimized when this number is smallest. As before, one needs
B < A to encode the correct problem. The number of spins required is |E| + |V |(|V | + |E|).

9. Graph Isomorphisms
Graphs G1 and G2 , with N vertices each, are isomorphic if there is a labeling of vertices 1, . . . , N in each
graph such that the adjacency matrices for the graphs is identical. More carefully: any graph G = (V, E),
with vertices labeled as 1, . . . , N , has an N × N adjacency matrix A with

1 (ij) ∈ E,
Aij =
,
(70)
0 (ij) ∈
/ E.
which contains all information about the edge set E. Let A1,2 be the adjacency matrices of graphs G1,2 .
If there is a permutation matrix P such that A2 = PT A1 P, then we say G1,2 are isomorphic.
The question of whether two graphs G1 = (V1 , E1 ) and G2 = (V2 , E2 ) are isomorphic is believed to
be hard, but its classification into a complexity class is still a mystery [55]. Since it is (in practice) a
hard problem, let us nonetheless describe an Ising formulation for it. An isomorphism is only possible
if |V1 | = |V2 | ≡ N , so we will restrict ourselves to this case, and without loss of generality, we label the
vertices of G1 with 1, . . . , N .
We write this as an Ising model as follows. Let us describe a proposed isomorphism through binary
variables xv,i which is 1 if vertex v in G2 gets mapped to vertex i in G1 . The energy

ensures that this map is bijective. We then use an energy

to penalize a bad mapping: i.e. an edge that is not in G1 is in G2 , or an edge that is in G1 is not in G2 .
As usual, assume A, B > 0. If the ground state of this Hamiltonian has H = 0, there is an isomorphism.
N 2 spins are required.
An approximate algorithm that uses quantum annealing to distinguish between non-isomorphic graphs
via the spectra of graph-dependent Hamiltonians was presented in [56].

10. Conclusions
The focus of research into AQO has essentially been on NP-complete/hard problems, because the Ising
model is NP-hard, and because computer scientists have struggled to find efficient ways of solving these
problems. In this paper, we have presented strategies for mapping a wide variety of NP problems to
Ising spin glasses, exemplified by a demonstration of a glass for each of Karp’s 21 NP-complete problems.
It is an open question the extent to which AQO will help provide efficient solutions for these problems,
whether these solutions are exact or approximate.
22

However, physicists are interested in building a universal quantum computer which is capable of
solving much more than just Ising models. As an example, a universal quantum
computer would also
√
reduce the time for searching an unsorted list of N items from O(N ) to O( N ) [57]. This would be
incredibly useful for many practical applications, despite the fact that searching is an easy linear time
algorithm. Analogously, it may be the case that there exists a family of “easy” problems which AQO can
solve in polynomial time, yet more efficiently than a classical polynomial time algorithm. This statement
may even be true with Ising-implementing AQO hardware, although if so it is not obvious.
It is certainly the case that an AQO-implementing device can be used to solve easy problems. Consider
the simple problem of finding the largest integer in a list n1 , . . . , nN (this is the searching algorithm that
a universal quantum computer can perform efficiently). Introducing binary variables xi for i = 1, . . . , N ,
the Ising model

for A > B max(ni ) solves this problem. In fact, this problem looks somewhat like an instance of the
random field Ising model on a complete graph, and yet this has a very simple O(N ) classical algorithm.
It would surely take longer to program this algorithm into a quantum device than to solve the problem
itself.
The above example demonstrates that sometimes the “hardness” of a problem can be deceptive – one
can phrase something that is easy in a way which makes it seem hard. It is worth discussing more closely
the hardness of NP problems, because it turns out that sometimes, NP problems can be easier than they
first appear. To be NP-complete but not P (if P 6= NP) one only needs a small family of instances of the
problem to be unsolvable in polynomial time by a deterministic algorithm. However, typical instances
may not be so hard. Many popular NP problems can almost surely be solved exactly in polynomial time
on large random instances [58, 59],15 and there exist randomized algorithms for some NP problems which
can get arbitrarily close to a solution with arbitrarily low failure probability in polynomial time [60, 61]
(though multiplicative coefficients or polynomial exponents must diverge as the failure probability and/or
error on determining the ground state tends to zero, if P 6= NP). In addition, popular algorithms in P, like
matrix decomposition, may serve as the bottlenecks of practical computations, and should not be thought
of as “easy”. Typical instances approach the asymptotic bounds on worst-case runtimes, in contrast to
the case for some NP problems; many recent developments focus on randomized algorithms [62, 63, 64].
The Hamiltonians of this paper may be deceptively “hard” – this can mean that they involve too
many spins. Another possibility is that these Hamiltonians have small spectral gaps, and that alternative
choices have much larger spectral gaps – this is a question we have not addressed at all in this paper.
Studying how to simplify quantum algorithms, and more importantly increase energy gaps (and thus
reduce T ), even by constant factors, is a much needed endeavor.

One has to be careful with the phrases “random” and “typical”, as this immediately implies a probability distribution
over a space of problem instances. This probability distribution may place vanishingly small probability on a set of relevant
instances for any given application. For the simple probability distributions used in these papers, it is highly non-trivial that
most instances turn out to be solvable in polynomial time.
