Abstract
The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a method that uses a hybrid
quantum-classical computational approach to find eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. VQE
has been proposed as an alternative to fully quantum algorithms such as quantum
phase estimation (QPE) because fully quantum algorithms require quantum hardware
that will not be accessible in the near future. VQE has been successfully applied to solve
the electronic Schrödinger equation for a variety of small molecules. However, the
scalability of this method is limited by two factors: the complexity of the quantum
circuits and the complexity of the classical optimization problem. Both of these factors
are affected by the choice of the variational ansatz used to represent the trial wave
function. Hence, the construction of an efficient ansatz is an active area of research. Put
another way, modern quantum computers are not capable of executing deep
quantum circuits produced by using currently available ansatzes for problems that
map onto more than several qubits. In this review, we present recent developments in
the field of designing efficient ansatzes that fall into two
categories—chemistry–inspired and hardware–efficient—that produce quantum
circuits that are easier to run on modern hardware. We discuss the shortfalls of ansatzes
originally formulated for VQE simulations, how they are addressed in more
sophisticated methods, and the potential ways for further improvements.

Introduction
Quantum simulation of chemistry and materials is an important application for classical computing. For example, one can predict the rates of chemical reactions, determine
molecular structure, and the properties of materials and molecules. It is achieved through
the solution of the electronic structure Hamiltonian, which allows one to describe the
properties of interacting electrons in the presence of stationary nuclei. The advent of
quantum computing holds promise for significantly speeding up these calculations, which
currently are done classically. This idea stems from the Feynman’s postulate in the famous
paper “Simulating Physics with Computers,” published in 1982 (Feynman 1982), that
to simulate quantum systems, one would need to build quantum computers to perform quantum computations, and it is much more efficient than doing it classically for

correlated systems. Indeed, one cannot simply scale the calculations on classical computers or apply massive parallelism because of the exponential growth of computational
requirements with the size of a chemical system and complexity.
These ideas look attractive in theory, but in reality, there are severe limitations in
the computational capabilities of the currently available small quantum devices, which
are often referred to as NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) devices (Preskill
2018). A second important aspect is the inefficiency of existing quantum algorithms
in terms of the resources that are needed to solve any useful problem on a quantum computer faster than on a classical computer, which is often discussed in terms
of the quantum advantage. For example, the resources estimated to perform chromium
dimer calculations, which is a large enough molecular system to demonstrate the quantum advantage on a quantum computer, with existing algorithms require at least 1
million physical qubits (Elfving et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2021) to make 60 virtual highfidelity qubits. At the same time, these physical qubits need higher fidelity than do
existing ones for error correction algorithms to work. This is far from the currently
available 71 physical qubit quantum computers and will remain the case for the near
future.
Another attractive idea is to use quantum computing on quantum devices to improve
quantum technology. Such a use will, in theory, allow systematic improvement of the
technology. In fact, it is one of the research objectives of the national quantum center
Q-NEXT (https://www.q-next.org/), which is tasked with exploring the potential of this
approach and developing new generations of methods.
The first algorithm that was proposed to solve the Schrödinger equation on a quantum computer was the quantum phase estimation (QPE) (Kitaev 1995; Abrams and Lloyd
1999; 1997). It is a fully quantum algorithm that can extract the phase or eigenvalues
of a unitary operator. By using the phase kickback trick and inverse quantum Fourier
transform (IQFT), (Shor 1994) QPE obtains the binary representation of the phase or
eigenvalue. The QPE algorithm is versatile and is a part of other quantum algorithms, such
as Shor’s algorithm. QPE can achieve exponential speedup in finding the eigenspectrum
of unitary operators, such as the electronic Hamiltonian, as long as an appropriate trial
state with nonzero overlap with the real solution can be prepared. It is likely that quantum
advantage can be demonstrated by using the QPE method when the first big enough faulttolerant quantum computer is built (Aharonov and Ben-Or 1996). However, the problem
with QPE, and IQFT in particular, is that it requires millions of qubits and gates even
for relatively small systems, a requirement far beyond the capabilities of present NISQ
hardware.
To address this problem, a variational hybrid quantum method VQE was proposed
(Peruzzo et al. 2014; McClean et al. 2016; Romero et al. 2018). VQE is designed to
utilize both quantum and classical resources to find variational solutions to eigenvalue
problems. In a typical setup, the ground state trial wave function of the molecule is constructed from operators generating single- and double-excitation configurations from a
Hartree-Fock wave function precomputed on a classical computer (UCCSD (Pal 1984;
Hoffmann and Simons 1988; Kutzelnigg 1991; Taube and Bartlett 2006; Sur et al. 2008;
Cooper and Knowles 2010; Harsha et al. 2018; Evangelista et al. 2019) ansatz). Next,
on a quantum computer, the trial wave function is prepared and the expectation value
of the Hamiltonian is measured. Then, the parameters of the trial wave function are

optimized iteratively on a classical computer using the variational principle. Although
VQE simulations for small molecules have been performed on various quantum hardware architectures (Peruzzo et al. 2014; Kandala et al. 2017; O’Malley et al. 2016; Nam et
al. 2020; Colless et al. 2018; Ryabinkin et al. 2018; McCaskey et al. 2019; Collaborators∗†
et al. 2020; Hempel et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2017; Santagati et al. 2018; Gao et al. 2021;
Gao et al. 2020; Smart and Mazziotti 2019), major advances are needed to scale this
approach to larger systems. VQE also suffers from the large size of the resulting quantum
circuits (albeit not as large as QPE circuits) coupled with the need to perform a classical
optimization on a large number of variational parameters, which can render calculations
intractable.
Trying to solve the electronic Schrödinger equation on a quantum computer translates
into massive quantum circuits, which are beyond the reach of NISQ computers. In the
rest of the paper, we will look in detail at different approaches, which aim to reduce the
size of circuits while maintaining high accuracy. Our paper is not a comprehensive review
of all VQE methods. Several comprehensive reviews covering VQE have been published
recently (McArdle and Endo 2020; Cao et al. 2019; Cerezo et al. 2021; Bharti et al. 2021).
The goal of this work is to present recent advances in methods that produce shorter VQE
circuits or provide higher accuracy. In addition, we discuss these methods in more detail
from a perspective of how they improve on the standard UCCSD and hardware–efficient
ansatzes.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a brief description
of the VQE method, required for understanding the rest of the paper, and introduce the
concepts of chemistry-inspired and hardware-efficient ansatzes. In Section 3 we discuss
the chemically inspired ansatzes for VQE simulations. Section 4 is devoted to hardware–
efficient ansatzes. In Section 5 the conclusions are presented.

Introduction to VQE
The VQE method was introduced to mitigate the significant hardware demands needed
by the QPE approach on NISQ devices. VQE is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm,
where the computational workload is shared between the classical and quantum components of the hardware Fig. 1. It starts with a reasonable assumption about the form of the
target wave function. The most common choice is to represent a wave function in a basis
of atom-centered Gaussian basis functions. However, plane wave basis sets (Babbush et al.
2018) can be used as well as the recently proposed “basis-set free” approach (Kottmann
et al. 2021). A trial wave function or ansatz is constructed with adjustable parameters,
followed by the design of a quantum circuit capable of realizing this ansatz. The ansatz
parameters are then variationally adjusted until the expectation value of the electronic

is minimized. In Eq. 1 |ψ(θ) is the trial wave function that depends on the vector of
variational parameters θ; E is the ground state energy of Ĥel , an electronic Hamiltonian
most commonly written in the second quantized form, although the first quantization
representation has also been considered (Babbush et al. 2019). In this work, we focus on
the second quantized form of the Hamiltonian

represent the wave function is chosen and initialized with the initial set of parameters θ0 . The trial state is
prepared on a quantum computer as a quantum circuit consisting of parametrized gates. The rest of the
procedure is performed repeatedly until the convergence criterion is met. At iteration k the energy of the
Hamiltonian is computed by measuring every Hamiltonian term ψ(θk )|Pj |ψ(θk ) on a quantum computer
and adding them on a classical computer. The energy E(θk ) is fed into the classical algorithm that updates
parameters for the next step of optimization θk+1 according to the chosen optimization algorithm

where a†p and ap are fermionic creation and annihilation operators, which excite and
deexcite electrons from orbital p. The first term in Eq. 2 corresponds to single-electron
excitations, and the second term corresponds to two-electron excitations; hpq and hpqrs
are one- and two-electron integrals that are easily computed on a classical computer.
To evaluate the energy on a quantum computer, the Hamiltonian for indistinguishable
fermions has to be mapped onto the Hamiltonian of distinguishable qubits by using one of
three common mappings: Jordan–Wigner (Jordan and Wigner 1928), parity (Bravyi et al.
2017), or Bravyi–Kitaev (Bravyi and Kitaev 2002). Regardless of the mapping choice, the
resulting qubit Hamiltonian can be written as

where αj are real scalar coefficients that depend on hpq and hpqrs . Pj are Pauli strings repj

contain up to M4 terms, where M is the number of basis functions. Since these terms
represented by the Pauli string operators Pj are non-commutative in general, the state
preparation step has to be performed repeatedly for each term that is measured separately. In addition, all the individual terms have to be measured enough times to build up
sufficient expectation value statistics. This way of computing energy is known as Hamiltonian averaging (McClean et al. 2014). Thus, the VQE approach trades long circuit depths
typically found in QPE for shorter state preparation circuits, at the expense of a greater
number of measurements, which scales as O 12 , where  is the desired precision. QPE
converges quadratically faster with scaling of O 1 (Wiebe and Granade 2016).
Shorter circuits make VQE more amenable to NISQ devices. Despite these advantages,
however, the performance of the algorithm depends largely on the quality and flexibility
of the trial ansatz. The approaches for ansatz design can be divided into three categories. Chemistry-inspired ansatzes are designed by using the domain knowledge from
traditional quantum chemistry in a way that every term in the ansatz describes a certain electron configuration. So-called hardware-efficient ansatzes are constructed from
a limited set of gates that are easy to implement on quantum hardware, but a chemical interpretation of each term is not generally possible. The third kind lies between the
chemistry-inspired and hardware-efficient and is called Hamiltonian variational ansatz
(Wecker et al. 2015). In the present work, we focus on the first two kinds.
The first VQE experiment by Peruzzo and co-workers (Peruzzo et al. 2014) utilized
the commonly used unitary coupled cluster with singles and doubles (UCCSD) ansatz,
which is a chemistry-inspired ansatz and represents a unitary version of the classical
non-unitary CCSD method. The UCCSD trial state is prepared from the initial state
|φ, usually, a Hartree–Fock mean-field wave function, by applying the exponentiated
 = eT̂−T̂ † :
excitation operator U(θ)

where the excitation operator T̂ = i T̂i is truncated at excitation level i. Truncation at
i = 2 yields the UCCSD ansatz, which includes single and double excitations:

tij â†i â†j âβ âα .
(6)
T̂UCCSD = T̂1 + T̂2 =

i,j∈virt,α,β∈occ

In Eq. 6, tiα and tijαβ are cluster amplitudes, occ denotes orbitals that are occupied in
the reference Hartree–Fock state, and virt denotes the virtual (unoccupied) orbitals. The
standard version of UCCSD has unfavorable scaling of the number of gates required for
implementation with an increasing number of electrons and spin orbitals (Kühn et al.
2019). This scaling is a result of many terms with near-zero contributions to the correlation energy. In this work, we consider some of the methods designed to improve that
scaling by choosing excitation operators that constitute the ansatz more efficiently.
Hardware-efficient ansatzes are composed of repeated, dense blocks of a limited selection of parametrized gates that are easy to implement with the available hardware. The
main idea behind this approach is to build a trial state that is flexible with as few gates
as possible. As a result, they are well adapted to the current quantum hardware. This
approach has been used to compute the ground state energies of small molecular systems on quantum hardware Kandala et al. (2017, 2019). Since this approach is agnostic
to the chemical nature of the system being simulated, it has some significant drawbacks.

The first problem shown by McClean and co-workers is the “barren plateaus” of the variational parameter landscape (McClean et al. 2018), where the derivative of the objective
function is close to zero. In addition, hardware-efficient ansatzes require extra work to
enforce the physical symmetries, such as electron parity. Not accounting for the symmetries increases the size of the solution space and complicates the variational parameter
optimization. This suggests that an arbitrary, unstructured ansatz can lead to poor convergence of the algorithm. Several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue
(Barkoutsos et al. 2018; Ganzhorn et al. 2019; Grant et al. 2019; Volkoff and Coles 2021).
Further work is needed, however, to improve this approach beyond small systems.
In the next sections, we discuss the recently proposed methods to construct more
efficient ansatzes using chemistry-inspired and hardware-efficient approaches. These
methods focus on improvements in different areas. They can be centered on constructing circuits with fewer CNOT gates that are easier to run on NISQ hardware, choosing
the operators that are added to the ansatz based on their contributions to the correlation
energy, or performing simulations with higher precision that goes beyond the standard
UCCSD. However, each of them can be considered a way to increase the size of the
molecules that can be accurately simulated on modern quantum computers.

Chemistry-Inspired ansatze
In this section, we discuss the ansatzes constructed in the fermionic space that use various
techniques to improve the UCCSD method to obtain shorter circuits that are easier to run
on NISQ hardware or obtain higher than UCCSD accuracy but with comparable circuit
depth.
Unitary pair coupled cluster with generalized singles and doubles product wave functions

One of the chemistry-inspired ansatzes designed to reduce circuit length is the Unitary
Pair CC with Generalized Singles and Doubles (k-UpCCGSD) method proposed by Lee
et al. (2018). The starting point for k-UpCCGSD is the unitary pair coupled cluster double
excitations method (UpCCD), which contains a significantly smaller number of operators
compared with UCCSD because it includes only two-electron excitations from occupied
spatial orbital i to unoccupied spatial orbital a:
 aα aβ
tiα iβ â†aα â†aβ âiβ âiα ,
(7)
T̂2 =
ia

where excitations are performed from occupied orbitals i to unoccupied orbitals a and α
and β represent spin. It suffers less from non-variationality and is able to correctly break
single bonds. However, it does not recover the dynamic correlation present in UCCD
and loses invariance to rotations in occupied-occupied and virtual-virtual subspaces. To
address these problems, in addition to pair double excitations, the full single excitations
are included in the UpCCSD. For increased accuracy, generalized single and double excitations are included so that there is no distinction between occupied and virtual orbitals
p and q when constructing excitations operators:
 q
 qα qβ
tp â†q âp +
tpα pβ â†qα â†qβ âpβ âpα .
(8)
T̂UpCCGSD = T̂1 + T̂2 =

We note that UCCGSD always produces more accurate results than UCCSD but at a
much higher computational cost. In UpCCGSD the cost is reduced by using only pair

double excitations. UpCCGSD is inferior to UCCGSD because of the large number of
missing double-excitation operators. For increased flexibility of ansatz, a product of k
unitary operators is included in the k-UpCCGSD ansatz, resulting in the final expression:
|ψk−UpCCGSD  =

k


eT̂

(α) −T̂ (α)†

|φ,

(9)

α=1

where |φ is the reference wave function and each operator T̂ (k) contains an independent
set of variational parameters for single and paired doubles CC amplitudes. Because of the
sparsity of the UpCCGSD operator, the cost to prepare a k-UpCCGSD state scales linearly
with the system size with a prefactor k. This structure also provides a way to systematically
improve accuracy by increasing k.
The k-UpCCGSD method has been tested on H4 , H2 O, and N2 molecules. Compared
with the UCCSD method, k-UpCCGSD offers higher accuracy for the ground state energy
with a smaller number of operators in the ansatz for all studied molecules. k-UpCCGSD
can achieve chemical accuracy with k = 2 for H4 (STO-3G and 6-31G basis sets) and
H2 O (STO-3G basis) molecules. UCCGSD is numerically exact for these systems, but it
requires more operators in the ansatz. For N2 molecule with STO-3G basis, k-UpCCGSD
requires k=4 to achieve chemical accuracy, whereas UCCSD with more operators fails to
come close to chemical accuracy and UCCGSD is within chemical accuracy but requires
double the number of operators compared with k-UpCCGSD.
Orbital optimized UCC (OO-UCC) ansatz

OO-UCC is another variant of the UCC approach (Mizukami et al. 2020) where a single
particle orbital rotation operator κ̂ = pq κpq a†p aq − a†q ap is introduced to the UCC
energy functional,
E(τ̂ , κ̂) =  |e−κ̂ Ĥeκ̂ |  = φ|e−τ̂ e−κ̂ Ĥeκ̂ eτ̂ |φ,

(10)

(here τ̂ = T̂ − T̂ † is the UCC cluster operator) to variationally determine the coupled cluster amplitudes and also molecular orbital coefficients. Note that optimizing
κ̂ is essentially equivalent to minimizing a wave function with respect to orbital rotation parameters. When τ̂ is fixed, κ̂ can be obtained through solving a linear equation,
Hκ = −g, where H and g are the electronic Hessian and gradient, respectively. In practice, the OO-UCC ansatz can be easily derived from the UCCSD-alike ansatz (also similar
to the DUCC ansatz discussed in the following section), except that only doubles are
included,
ˆ

| UCCSD = eτ̂1 +τ̂2 |φ ⇒ | UCCSD = eτ̂2 eτ̂1 |φ ⇒ | OO-UCCD = eτ̃2 |φ̃,

(11)

where τ̂1 and τ̂2 don’t commute, and the singles part eτ̂1 takes the role of carrying out
orbital rotations that would be variationally optimized to obtain |φ̃ = eτ̂1 |φ by using
ˆ
a classical computer, while the doubles part, eτ̃2 , is optimized by the VQE. We note that
the variational orbitals obtained from the OO-UCCD approach coincide with the commonly known Brueckner orbitals. The reported numerical testing on small molecules has
shown that in comparison with conventional UCCSD ansatzes, the qubitization of the
OO-UCCD ansatz allows a slight reduction in the number of VQE parameters and the
circuit depth. For example, for the NH3 molecule with the STO-3G basis set, the number
of the VQE parameters and the circuit depth required in the OO-UCCD approach were

Fedorov et al. Materials Theory

(2022) 6:2

Page 8 of 21

120 and 2,720, respectively, while those required by the conventional UCCSD were 135
and 2,780, respectively. Regarding accuracy, OO-UCCD maintains a similar level of accuracy to that of UCCSD for most of the small molecules except for LiH, where OO-UCCD
results are closer to the full configuration interaction (FCI) results than to UCCSD.
Double unitary coupled cluster (DUCC) ansatz

In modeling second-quantized problems, the major challenge comes from the sizable
number of qubits that scales linearly with the size of the basis. To address this issue and
enable more realistic simulations on NISQ computers, active space approximations are
often employed. Along this line, Metcalf et al. (2020) recently reported VQE applications based on DUCC ansatz that originate from the subsystem embedding sub-algebras
coupled cluster studies (Kowalski 2018) to constitute the effective form of the system
Hamiltonian
1
H̄ eff = e−σext Heσext ≈ H+[ HN , σext ] + [ [ FN , σext ] , σext ] ,
2

(12)

where FN and HN are normal product forms of Fock and Hamiltonian operators, respec†
is the anti-Hermitian cluster operator constructed from the
tively, and σext = T̂ext − T̂ext
cluster operators that produce excited configuration outside of the active space when acting on the reference |φ. After the projection, the energy of the whole system, E, can be
directly obtained by diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian
H̄ eff eσint |φ = Eeσint |φ

(13)

with the eigenvector being the excited configurations within the active space.
Note that the DUCC formalism, just like the conventional CC formalism, is formally
exact and independent of the choice of the active space, thus providing a systematically
improvable hierarchy for implementation. Practically, the accuracy of the DUCC ansatzes
depends on the approximate level of the effective Hamiltonian H̄ eff that can be controlled
through either the length of the similarity expansion e−σext Heσext or the many-body terms
included in σext (and T̂ext ), or both. Also, when working with the VQE algorithm, another
source of approximation comes from the unitary ansatz for the active space.
For example, the reported DUCC-VQE algorithms include a DUCC effective Hamiltonian truncated at the second-order (see Eq. (12)) and a UCCSD ansatz acting on the
active space. In preliminary DUCC-VQE calculations on H2 , Li2 , and BeH2 molecules
(Metcalf et al. 2020), the DUCC Hamiltonians have been shown to significantly outperform the bare Hamiltonian on the same active space in terms of approaching closer to the
FCI results.
Quantum subspace expansion (QSE)

The QSE scheme is similar to the generalized eigenvalue problem that is often encountered in quantum chemistry, where the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in a general nonorthogonal basis of many-body states, (McClean et al. 2017; Colless et al. 2018; Takeshita
et al. 2020; Motta et al. 2019; Huggins et al. 2020; Parrish and McMahon 2019; Ollitrault
et al. 2020; Stair et al. 2020)
Hc = ScE.

Here the elements of the overlap matrix (S) and Hamiltonian matrix (H) in the nonorthogonal basis { i , i = 1, 2, · · ·} are given by
Sij = 

i|

j ,

Ĥij = 

i |H|

j .

(15)

Compared to the fully classical analog, the QSE quantum simulations utilize quantum
devices to construct and store the arbitrarily complex states and measure the overlapping
and Hamiltonian matrix elements, while leaving the corresponding eigenvalue problem
to the classical machinery.
The many-body basis required for the QSE quantum simulations can be generated
in many different ways. For example, analogous to the classical truncated configuration
interaction expansion, McClean and co-workers proposed diagonalizing the Hamiltonian
in the basis of states a†i aj |φ with |φ being a reference state obtained from a VQE run
(McClean et al. 2017; Colless et al. 2018; Takeshita et al. 2020). The Hamiltonian elements in this basis are the three- and four-body density matrices. Following this line, the
many-body basis can be employed to construct a Krylov subspace to improve efficiency
and accuracy (Motta et al. 2019; Stair et al. 2020). One of the proposed approaches is
the quantum Lanczos (QLanczos) algorithm (Motta et al. 2019), where the basis is the
imaginary-time evolution of a single reference state sampled at regular intervals in imag
inary time. In QLanczos, for a qubit-encoded Hamiltonian H = j Hj (here Hj = αj Pj
with αj complex scalars and Pj Pauli string), the infinitesimal imaginary-time propagator
e τ Hj is mirrored by a unitary evolution ei τ Aj acting on properly normalized states. One
can show from the Taylor expansion of the time propagator that for an infinitesimal time
step, the propagator would span a classical Krylov space. Similarly, via real-time evolution of a set of reference states, Stair et al. (2020) also proposed a multireference selected
quantum Krylov (MRSQK) algorithm based on QSE as an alternative to the quantum
phase estimation algorithm and have shown that the proposed approach is able to capture the important multideterminantal features (if any) of the wave function and predict
the energy of strongly correlated target states.
An alternative approach for creating and utilizing the Krylov subspace was recently
proposed by (Kowalski and Peng 2020; Peng and Kowalski 2021). They found that the connected moments expansion, proposed and intensively developed in the 1980s and 1990s
(Horn and Weinstein 1984; Cioslowski 1987; Peeters and Devreese 1984; Soldatov 1995),
can be employed to re-engineer the energy functional to return a better energy estimate
than the straightforward expectation value of the Hamiltonian operator for some trial
wave function. Preliminary results on simple molecules and models exhibit high accuracy
at finding the ground and excited states and their energies through the rotation of the
trial wave function of modest quality, (Kowalski and Peng 2020) and potential capability
to circumvent the ‘barren plateau’ problem (Peng and Kowalski 2021).
We note that despite their higher accuracy and fewer numerical parameters to optimize,
QSE methods also expose some practical issues. For example, almost all the abovementioned QSE methods suffer from the linearly dependent basis that is generated
from the procedure, which would cause numerical instabilities when solving the eigenvalue problem. When accounting for hardware noise, the instability would be potentially
amplified, leading to worse gate fidelity and larger measurement errors. Furthermore,

Quantum anti-Hermitian contracted schrödinger equation

Contracted Schrödinger equation (CSE) is an approach from the classical electronic structure theory that is based on the reduced density matrix (RDM) theory and solves the
contracted eigenvalue equation. The N-electron Schrödinger equation is contracted onto
the space of two electrons (Mazziotti 1998; 2002). The anti-Hermitian part of CSE,
known as ACSE, has been used to find energies of the ground and excited states in
strongly correlated systems on classical computers (Mazziotti 2004; 2020; 2006; 2007;
Gidofalvi and Mazziotti 2009; Mukherjee and Kutzelnigg 2001).
The anti-Hermitian part of the CSE reads:
ψ|[ â†i â†j âk âl , Ĥ] |ψ = 0.

(16)

To solve the ACSE, the variational wave function ansatz is constructed iteratively by
adding unitary two-body exponential operators:
|ψn+1  = e Ân |ψn ,
where Ân is anti-hermitian two-body operator
 pqrs
An â†p â†q âs âr .
Ân =

(18)

pqrs

The energy at iteration n+1 is expressed as
En+1 = En + ψn |[ Ĥ, Ân ] |ψn  + O( 2 ).

(19)

From Eq. 19 it is easy to derive the gradient of the energy with respect to variational

∂(An )

(20)

The gradient in Eq. 20 is the residual of the ACSE. It vanishes if and only if ACSE is
satisfied, meaning that the wave function at iteration n has converged and the minimum
of energy is found. On a classical computer, the solution of ACSE for the 2-particle RDM is
indeterminant without the storage or reconstruction of 3-RDM, for which the cost scales
exponentially. The quantum algorithm for solving the ACSE, (Smart and Mazziotti 2021)
however, can be used to solve for 2-RDM without 3-RDM reconstruction. In QACSE the
±iδ Ĥ |  are prepared on a quantum computer. Then, the 2auxiliary states |±

This measurement of A matrix on a quantum computer allows to avoid 3-RDM reconstruction. Thus, the QACSE algorithm has a potentially exponential speed-up compared
to the classical one with full RDM reconstruction. The QACSE algorithm has been applied
to H2 , H3 , and C6 H4 molecules on quantum hardware (Smart and Mazziotti 2021; Smart
et al. 2021).
It is important to note that the ACSE wave function also served as an inspiration for the
development of the ADAPT-VQE ansatz and its different forms discussed in this article.

Equation 20 is central in constructing ADAPT-VQE ansatz as it allows to find the operator
from the pool, which will result in the largest contribution to correlation energy.
Adaptive derivative-Assembled pseudo-Trotter ansatz variational quantum eigensolver
(ADAPT-VQE)

Grimsley et al. introduced the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter ansatz
Variational Quantum Eigensolver, or ADAPT-VQE in short (Grimsley et al. 2019). The
key idea of the method is to construct an ansatz that would recover the most correlation energy with the least number of fermionic operators and variational parameters.
It is inspired by the iterative algorithm for the ACSE solution (see previous section for
details). The first step is to define a pool of operators that contains all fermionic excitation operators that can be added to the ansatz. In principle, this pool can be constructed
from any set of operators, but the most straightforward choice is to use operators generated by the unitary coupled cluster ansatz. The use of the generalized version of UCCSD
allows achieving higher than UCCSD accuracy with a smaller number of operators. In
the generalized version (UCCGSD) (Lee et al. 2018) the operators are formed through
single and double excitations over all occupied and virtual orbitals, which are not distinguished in this approach (Eq. 7). Potentially, higher-order excitations can be included.
After performing standard computations of one- and two-electron integrals along with
reference Hartree–Fock wave function |φ on a classical computer the algorithm starts
to gradually grow the variational ansatz with operators that would contribute the most
correlation energy. Such operators are found through the computation of the following
energy derivatives with respect to the variational parameters:
∂E
= ψ|[ Ĥ, τ̂i ] |ψ,
∂θi

(22)
pq

rs = t̂ rs − t̂ .
where τ̂i is a sum of excitation and de-excitation operators, for example, τ̂pq
rs
pq
Equation 22 for computation of the gradient is equivalent to Eq. 20 derive in the previous
section of this article that describes ACSE. At every ADAPT-VQE step, one operator is
added and full VQE optimization of all parameters is performed. The process is repeated
until the convergence criterion is met when the norm of the gradient vector becomes
smaller than the predefined threshold:

 
 ∂E 2

When convergence is achieved, the algorithm produces the following ansatz:
|ψ ADAPT  = eτ̂N

eτ̂N−1 ... eτ̂2

eτ̂1 |φ.

(24)

The ADAPT-VQE method has advantages compared with UCCSD for performing simulations on NISQ hardware. Compared with the UCCSD ansatz that produces many
redundant terms contributing little to the correlation energy, ADAPT-VQE contains a
much smaller number of operators. As a result, the quantum circuits are much shorter,
which can enable simulations on quantum hardware for larger molecules than what is
possible with UCCSD ansatz. In addition, it addresses perhaps the weakest quality of
the VQE method, namely, that classical parameter optimization in VQE can become
intractable because of barren plateaus (McClean et al. 2018) or simply because the number of variational parameters is too large. ADAPT-VQE adds operators only with the

Fedorov et al. Materials Theory

(2022) 6:2

highest contribution to the correlation energy and avoids the problem of having to optimize a large number of parameters with near-zero contributions. Another advantage is
that parameters are optimized one at a time, so every iteration of ADAPT-VQE is started
with all parameters preoptimized, except for the one newly added, which is likely to accelerate the rate of convergence. Another benefit of ADAPT-VQE is that the accuracy of
the method can be controlled by adjusting the convergence criterion. When higher accuracy is needed, one can simply add operators with smaller contributions in the order of
decreasing gradients (Eq. 22) systematically converging to the solution provided by the
full operator pool.
When considering the cost of simulations using a certain algorithm on NISQ hardware,
among the most critical metrics are circuit depth, which is limited because of the short
coherence times and large error rates, and the total shot count, which defines the time
to solution. ADAPT-VQE is successful in identifying short and accurate ansatzes. However, the total shot count can drastically exceed the shot count for UCCSD ansatz. The
reason is mainly that the number of energy gradients to be computed at each ADAPT
iteration is equal to the number of operators in the pool, which grows quickly with system
size. Another factor that increases the time to solution is that the number of VQE optimizations is equal to the final number of operators in the ansatz. Therefore, the time to
solution can become unfeasible for large molecules, requiring a large number of operators
to converge. We point out that for NISQ devices with limited coherence times, shorter circuits are more critical than total shot count and can be a defining factor if the simulation
can be performed at all.
The examples of ADAPT-VQE implementation of ADAPT-VQE include potential energies of LiH, BeH2 , and highly correlated H6 molecules using the STO-3G basis set. For
the LiH molecule, the UCCSD ansatz produces results within chemical accuracy across
the whole PES. ADAPT-VQE produces the same or better results with around 20 parameters instead of 60 required by UCCSD. With extra parameters, the errors can be reduced
further. With an additional 5 parameters, the error is consistently under 10−3 kcal/mol.
For the BeH2 molecule, UCCSD is within chemical accuracy around equilibrium; but
for longer internuclear distances, the error gets larger than 1 kcal/mol. ADAPT-VQE
achieves accuracies around 0.1 kcal/mol across the whole PES using around 30 parameters instead of 120 in UCCSD. For the H6 molecule, ADAPT-VQE also outperforms
UCCSD. The number of required parameters grows significantly for longer distances to
describe this highly correlated system.
As with any adaptive method, estimating the resources required to perform a simulation
is difficult. It strongly depends on the chemical system, initial operator pool, and specifics
of the implementation. In the original implementation, (Grimsley et al. 2019) operators
are added one by one, and all parameters are reoptimized at every ADAPT-VQE iteration. Adding operators in batches can help reduce the cost, as can freezing some of the
parameters for a certain number of iterations. Another way to reduce the shot count is
to pre-screen the operators in the pool by using various techniques, for example, MP2
amplitude screening. Additionally, to reduce the time to solution, one can take advantage
of the fact that the gradient calculations are independent and can be parallelized by using
multiple quantum computers. Because of the limited availability of quantum hardware,
however, this can still be a problem.

qubit-ADAPT-VQE

Although the ADAPT-VQE algorithm allows one to significantly reduce the circuit depth
compared with the UCCSD ansatz while achieving higher accuracy, the resulting quantum circuits are still beyond the reach of NISQ devices. Particularly problematic are the
multi-qubit (e.g., CNOT) gates since they tend to have much higher error rates compared
with 1-qubit gates. To reduce the number of CNOT gates in the circuits, Tang et al. proposed the qubit-ADAPT-VQE algorithm (Tang et al. 2021). In this algorithm, the general
concept is the same as in the original ADAPT-VQE, but instead of fermionic operators,

the individual Pauli strings form the operator pool τ̂ = P̂ = i i pi , pi ∈ {X, Y , Z}. These
strings are obtained from the strings that are generated in the fermionic pool. This ansatz
yields shallower circuits with fewer CNOT gates compared with the fermionic ADAPTVQE, but at a cost of a larger number of variational parameters. Essentially, it is a way
of offloading the computational effort from a quantum processor to a classical computer
motivated by the limitations of NISQ hardware. The qubit-ADAPT-VQE approach uses
the same procedure to add operators from the operator pool to the ansatz by computing gradients of energy with respect to the variational parameters associated with the
operators. Because of the larger number of parameters compared with the fermionic
ADAPT, the “qubit pool” requires more gradient calculations on a quantum computer.
The number of operators in the pool scales exponentially as 2n − 1. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate redundant operators from the pool to reduce its size. First, the strings
with an even number of Y operators are eliminated to ensure that the fermionic opera
tor P̂ = i i pi , pi ∈ {X, Y , Z} is real. In addition, chains of Z gates are removed from
the pool since they do not affect the performance of the method according to numerical simulations. However, the size of this “qubit pool” remains large. Also, it is important
to note that the chains of Z gates are responsible for enforcing the anti-symmetry of
the electronic wave function. The removal of these gates did not affect the numerical
results for small test molecules but the effect of this symmetry removal on the accuracy
of description of larger molecules is still unknown. It has been shown that the size of
the qubit-ADAPT-VQE pool can be reduced dramatically without sacrificing accuracy,
and it has been analytically proven that complete pools of size 2n − 2 exist for any n
(Grimsley et al. 2019). The recipe for constructing such a minimal complete pool is a
direction for future research. If the extra measurement overhead in qubit-ADAPT-VQE
can be reduced by an efficient algorithm for finding a complete pool, this method will be
a good fit for applications on NISQ hardware, as long as the classical optimization part
can be efficiently solved. The qubit-ADAPT-VQE method was tested on H4 , H6 , and LiH
molecules using STO-3G basis set. It can achieve the same accuracy as does the fermionic
ADAPT with fewer CNOT gates but with a larger number of ADAPT iterations because
of the larger number of variational parameters.

Hardware-Efficient ansatzes
In this section, we discuss hardware-efficient ansatzes that produce quantum circuits that
are easier to run on modern quantum hardware.
Symmetry-Preserving state preparation

The idea of imposing symmetries associated with particle number, spin, and time-reversal
symmetries goes along with the approach that bases the VQE ansatzes on the capabilities

Page 13 of 21

Fedorov et al. Materials Theory

(2022) 6:2

of the hardware and performs state preparation through combining parameterized gates
available on the processor (Bian et al. 2019; Gard et al. 2020).
The ansatzes in this category have the advantage of being compatible with the capabilities of the hardware, but the ad hoc ansatzes of this type can also cause the so-called
“barren plateaus” problem (McClean et al. 2018), where gradients vanish exponentially in
sufficiently expressive parameterized quantum circuits, which in turn requires an exponentially large precision to navigate through the “barren plateaus” landscape. Similar
problems (i.e., gradient-vanishing) existed in the early studies of deep neural networks
(Bradley et al. 2009; Shalev-Shwartz et al. 2017; Kremer and Kolen 2001) with mitigation
techniques proposed later on (LeCun et al. 2015; Ioffe and Szegedy 2015; Hinton et al.
2006; He et al. 2016). Nevertheless, for hardware-based ansatzes to be successful in solving the problems of interest, most of the approaches have focused on assuring that the
hardware-based ansatzes span the part of the Hilbert space that includes the true solution.
So far, two ways have been employed for facilitating the access of the parameterized
quantum circuits to the “right” part of the Hilbert space. On the one hand, penalty terms
can be implemented in the VQE energy function for symmetry violations (McClean et
al. 2016; Ryabinkin et al. 2019). On the other hand, the state preparation circuits need
to be carefully designed to preserve appropriate symmetries regardless of variational
parameter rotation. An early attempt in this direction (Wang et al. 2009), in comparison
with preparing a general state in the full Hilbert space of n qubits that requires O(2n )
controlled-NOT gates, shows the actual number of the controlled-NOT gates required for
exploring a smaller Hilbert space, where the true solution scales only polynomially with
the number of qubits, which can still be greatly reduced by several orders of magnitude
by properly designing the quantum algorithm that accounts for additional symmetries.
Similar advantages have also been reported by Barkoutsos et al. (2018), who found the
reformulation of the molecular Hamiltonian in second quantization using the particlehole picture in conjunction with a parameterized particle-conserving exchange-type gate
(Ganzhorn et al. 2019; Roth et al. 2017; Egger et al. 2019; Sagastizabal et al. 2019) is able to
improve the computational efficiency and accuracy for quantum chemistry simulations.
Nevertheless, important open questions remain, including how other symmetries can be
built into the circuits and whether more efficient circuits exist that contain the minimal number of parameters necessary to span the symmetry subspace. To encode other
symmetries into the circuits, while still balancing the efficiency and accuracy, Gard et al.
(2020) introduced generalized state preparation circuits that accommodate well-defined
symmetries (including particle number, total spin, spin projection, and time reversal) and
require a minimal number of parameters to directly target the appropriate symmetry subspace. Although tested only for H2 and LiH molecules, it is shown that the circuits are
able to locate the true ground state within the subspace of states spanned by the circuit
and reduce the complexity of the classical optimization step of the VQE algorithm, thus
outperforming the standard state preparation ansatze.
Despite these efforts, as well as more recent ones (Fontana et al. 2020; Anand et al.
2021; Arrasmith et al. 2021; Uvarov and Biamonte 2021; Zhang et al. 2020; Pesah et al.
2021), it is still too early to claim success since additional difficulties can come from hardware noise that can potentially modify the cost landscape associated with the parameter
space. For example, a recent study (Fontana et al. 2020) found that the hardware noise
(specifically non-unital noise) can break the underlying symmetries in parameterized

quantum circuits and lift the degeneracy of minima that falsifies local minima as global
minima.
Qubit coupled cluster method

The qubit coupled cluster (QCC) method introduced by Ryabinkin et al. (2018) resembles
the structure of coupled cluster; but instead of using fermionic excitations, the ansatz is
built directly in the qubit space. The QCC wave function is of the form
|(τ , ) = Û(τ )|.

(25)

The mean-field wave function | is a product of single-qubit states
| =

EQCC = min(τ , )|Ĥ|(τ , ) = min|U(τ )† ĤU(τ )|.

(29)

Similar to other hardware-efficient methods working directly in the qubit space, QCC
ansatz can result in unphysical results, for example breaking of symmetries, such as nonconservation of the total number of particles or obtaining a state with a wrong electronic
spin. This problem has been shown (Ryabinkin et al. 2019) to be more a rule than an
exception. Therefore, additional constraints need to be used to ensure that results do not
violate any physical laws. Yen et al. (2019) proposed symmetry projectors that can enforce
the symmetries and implemented these projectors with the QCC method.
The total number of operators in the transformed Hamiltonian U(τ )† ĤU(τ ) scales
exponentially and contains 3Nent parameters. Therefore, the operators with the largest
contribution to the correlation energy need to be chosen to avoid exponential scaling. In
the QCC framework such screening of operators is performed by computing the energy
derivative with respect to τk at τk = 0:

The entanglers responsible for the largest energy reduction are ranked in order of
decreasing first energy derivatives. If the first derivative vanishes, the second tier of entanglers can be formed by performing ranking using the second derivatives. Thus, the QCC
ansatz can be expanded systematically based on this ranking, with more terms recovering
a larger amount of correlation energy. By including less important terms, one can systematically approach the exact solution. However, the computational complexity of this
screening procedure is exponential with respect to the number of terms in the Hamiltonian. The screening procedure can be improved by taking advantage of the Hamiltonian
symmetry and splitting operators into groups, which results in the polynomial complexity
for screening the operators (Ryabinkin et al. 2020).
Another shortcoming of QCC, an exponential number of operators, which restricts
the application of QCC to small systems, was addressed in the iterative version of the
QCC method (iQCC) (Ryabinkin et al. 2020). In this method, the “dressed” canonically
transformed Hamiltonian is considered:
Ĥd = Û † (τ )Ĥ Û(τ ).

(31)

The dressed Hamiltonian is evaluated recursively according to
(k)

(k−1)

Ĥd (τk , ..., τ1 ) = eiτk P̂k /2 Ĥd

+ P̂k Ĥd
, P̂k (1 − cos τk ) ,
2
where k = 1, ..., Nent . Instead of optimizing all Nent amplitudes at once, the amplitudes
can be optimized sequentially by introducing one or more operators at each iteration.
During each iQCC iteration Nent ≥ 1 amplitudes are optimized using the Hamiltonian
from the previous step. Then the optimized amplitudes are used to construct the dressed
Hamiltonian (Eq. 29) for the next iteration according to Eq. (32).
In general, this procedure introduces 3Nent distinct operators and shows the exponential complexity of the QCC ansatz. It has been demonstrated that if the amplitudes τ in
Eq. (32) are fixed, the complexity of transforming the dressed Hamiltonian in Eq. (31) is
∼ M(3/2)Nent , where M is the number of terms in the Hamiltonian. The (3/2)Nent factor comes from the canonical transformation of Hamiltonian Eq. (31) at each step of
iQCC and for larger systems can make simulation prohibitively expensive. This problem can be partially solved by “compressing” the dressed Hamiltonian. This procedure
essentially removes the terms from the Hamiltonian with little contribution to the ground
state energy in a controlled manner so that the energy changes by no more than desired
accuracy . Numerical examples have shown that the compressing procedure reduces
the (3/2)Nent factor. The benefits from this procedure increase for larger systems where
the fraction of terms with a small contribution to energy in the Hamiltonian becomes
large. In a more recent effort, aiming at reducing the number of operators in the dressed
Hamiltonian, Eq. (32), Izmaylov group introduced involutory linear combinations (ILC) of
anti-commuting Pauli products (i.e. entanglers) in the QCC framework, (Lang et al. 2021)
and the resulting QCC-ILC unitary dressing gives an exact quadratic truncation of the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion which, in comparison to the random QCC transformation, only results in quadratic growth of the number of Pauli strings in the dressed
Hamiltonian while still yields accurate energy estimates in the strongly correlated regime.

QCC has been benchmarked on LiH, H2 O, and N2 molecules using the STO-3G basis.
Chemical accuracy was achieved for these small molecules. However, performing QCC
calculations on large molecules would require further improvements to the algorithm, in
particular, the (3/2)Nent factor appearing in the dressed Hamiltonian transformation.

Conclusions
The main shortcoming of the standard UCCSD ansatz for VQE simulations is rooted in
the overall number of excitations. Although each excitation operator generally adds only
one variational parameter, the total number of excitations grows rapidly with system size.
A large number of amplitudes increases the length of circuits, thus increasing the load
on the quantum computer. At the same time, a larger number of parameters have to be
optimized within the classical VQE loop. Moreover, circuits to implement fermionic excitations contain a large number of multi-qubit gates, which are a problem for simulations
on NISQ hardware because of the large error rates of multi-qubit gates. The methods
described in this paper are designed to construct short-depth ansatzes that are easier to
run on NISQ hardware. In general, chemistry-inspired ansatzes have a goal of a more
careful choice of excitations to include in the ansatz, while hardware-efficient approaches
focus on the reduction of the number of multi-qubit gates and using various techniques
to choose compact blocks of entangling gates with single-qubit rotational gates more
efficiently.
In adaptive methods that include ADAPT, qubit-ADAPT-VQE, and QCC methods, the
addition of the operators to the ansatz is based on the calculation of the gradient of energy
with respect to the parameter associated with this operator, where the largest gradient
corresponds to the largest contribution to the correlation energy. It is straightforward to
ensure that an ansatz does not contain redundant terms that complicate classical optimization and make quantum circuits longer. Doing so, however, comes at the cost of
extra measurements associated with gradient calculations used to choose the operators
contributing the most amount of correlation energy. QCC and qubit-ADAPT-VQE work
directly in the qubit space and are considered more “hardware-efficient” because they
are generally more compact and easier to run on NISQ hardware. However, they require
additional work to ensure the preservation of all physical symmetries. UCC-based methods such as ADAPT-VQE, k-UpCCGSD, DUCC, OO-UCC, and ansatz are constructed
from fermionic operators and therefore avoid the problems with symmetry preservation.
However, the number of multi-qubit gates remains high in this method, which requires
the error rates on quantum hardware to significantly improve before such methods can be
used. On the other hand, QSE-based approaches exhibit higher accuracy from ansatzes
prepared with relatively low circuit depth and require fewer numerical parameters to be
optimized, but they need extra measurements for Hamiltonian powers, overlap matrix,
and/or energy gradient, and may suffer from the linearly dependent many-body basis.
Thus many issues still are left to be resolved, and significant progress is expected in these
directions in the post-VQE era.
